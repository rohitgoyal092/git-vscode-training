- CSS can be loaded externally, internally or inline in the element tag itself.
- Specificity rules : 
  - General preference on the innermost tag.
  - In case of multiple classes, ids on the same tag, preference is based on (id cnt -> class cnt).
  - In case of same specs defined above, it follows order of definition inside the css.
  - Inline style beats even id->cnt's.
  - "!important" property in the definition of a class beats inline too.
  - Innermost tag > (!important for a property) > (inline) > (id cnt) > (class cnt)

Selector & Combinator : 
- Selector - used to select a set of elements : 
  - *{}, p{}, .class_name{}, #id_name{}, [data_type (*$|)= ""]
  - compund selected, tag.class, specifies a tag "a" that has a class label "b".
- Combinator - used to fine grain selection, works between 2 selectors : 
  - Descendent Combinator : Recursive, applies subsequence matching to apply properties (Read MDN)
  - Next Sibling : Targets only 2nd children if not used with universal selector, Recursive otherwise
  - Subsequent Sibling : Targets all of the children compared to Next Sibling.
  - Child Combinator : Used to specify immediate children only, to remove recursive changes.
